# FriendFinder
The task in this assignment was to make a friend finder app. You would enter the site and take a short survery which would save your scores and then show you someone who was the closest match to you in terms of answers and then their picture and name would display to the user. It was actually quite similar to a dating website. I am speaking from experience here and it was just as arbitrary in this as it was on dating sites. I created an array of objects that would contained the friends and an array of their scores as well as their pictures and their first name. Then I created a survery with questions and a way to save the scores to a database. After taking the survery the user would see the picture and name of the person whose scores were the closest to theirs. This was a combined front and back end effort.
Tools used: App.js, NPM packages, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Ajax and routing.
